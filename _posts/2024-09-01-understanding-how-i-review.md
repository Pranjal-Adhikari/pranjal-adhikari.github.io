This is an example of how I will format my reviews, as I do on my JoCo library reviews. There will be the TITLE and AUTHOR as my post title, and a short description seen on the home page for the post. I will also be including the relevant genres/tags from Goodreads on each post to categorize my readings.

Below is an example of how I will format each of my reviews. 

## TL;WR 
(Too Long; Wonâ€™t Read)

[This is where I will put my version of a "TL;DR" (too long, didn't read) at the very start of my book reviews. It just makes more sense then putting a TL;DR at the end of my review, where people are less likely to go.]

## LONGER REVIEW

[This is where I will give my full review. I will usually have a one-sentence description here to introduce the novel, author, and relevant genres and/or themes.]

### Summary: 

[This is where I will put my version of the synopsis of the story. I take heavy inspiration from the original story synopses.]

### Opinion:

[Probably the longest part of the review, where, as shown by the heading, I give my full opinion of the novel, and whether or not I would give it a read if I were you.
