# Paucitic
---
```
pau·ci·ty
/ˈpôsədē/
noun
the presence of something only in small or insufficient quantities or amounts; scarcity.
"a paucity of information"
```

Although I have never seen the term "paucitic" used before, I believe it to be a variation of "paucity." The name of this blog is thus due to my very scarce amount of book reviews.

This blog features my book reviews which I submit to the Johnson County Public Library, Samaritan website as well. 

I may ocassionally have some actual blog posts, which are not reviews. I hope to have at least one book review per week, based on the fact that I wish to read at least one book per week during my high school career. 

Cheers to a good reading. :)
